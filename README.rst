cInterpol
=============

cInterpol_ is a python extension for optimized interpolation of
data series for which each data point one knows the up to N-th order derivative.

It provides a close to 6 orders of magnitude faster (albeit less general)
version of `scipy.interpolate.PiecewisePolynomial` (my Core i7-3770K give ~800 000x speed-up). 

See examples/perf.py for a quick head-on benchmark between those two
(expect a runtime on the order of half a minute).  The performance is
achieved through the use of multithreaded (OpenMP) C routines (wrapped using Cython).

The formulae for the coefficients are generated using Sympy, and can in theory be modified quite easily.

Installation
============
Using pip:
`pip install https://github.com/bjodah/cinterpol/archive/v0.2.2.tar.gz`
Manual installation:
1. Clone repository `git clone https://github.com/bjodah/cinterpol.git`
2. Install dependencies `cd cinterpol; pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Install run `sudo python setup.py install` or `python setup.py install --user`.

See distutils' documentation_ for more options.

Tests
=====
Run `py.test` if py.test is installed on your system.
Elsewise: `cd cInterpol/tests/; make tests`

Performance tests
-----------------
See examples/perf.py, as of SciPy 0.11 you should expect about 5
orders of magnitude speed-up.


Dependencies
============
* Python_
* NumPy_

There is a git subtree under cInterpol, update though:
`git subtree --prefix cInterpol/newton_interval pull newton_interval master`
where the repo "newton_interval" is https://github.com/bjodah/newton_interval.git
