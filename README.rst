cInterpol
=============

cInterpol_ is a small python extension for optimized interpolation of
data series for which each time point has up to N-th order derivative.

It provides a c:a 5 orders of magnitude faster (albeit less general)
version of `scipy.interpolate.PiecewisePolynomial` (on my dual core laptop I get speed-up of 160 000x). 

See examples/perf.py for a quick head-on benchmark between those two
(expect a runtime on the order of half a minute).  The performance is
achieved through the use of multithreaded (OpenMP) C
 (with some equations generated through Sympy) and Cython.

Capabilities
============
cInterpol has a few related capabilies:

PiecewisePolynomial
-------------------
Original motivation

Finite difference (inter/extra)polation of derivatives
------------------------------------------------------
Bengt Fornberg formulae implemented in Fortran 90.

InvNewton
---------
InvNewton still has bugs (try changing to -0.7 and it works): 
``` python -m pudb invnewton_main.py -y 'tan(x)' -l 5 -o 3 --sample-N 1000 --x-lo -0.8 --x-hi 1.0 ```


Installation
============
To install run `python setup.py install`.
See distutils' documentation_ for more options.

.. _documentation: http://docs.python.org/2/library/distutils.html

Files
=====
core.pyx - The pythonic (cython) interface to the C routines
newton_interval.c - Quadratic order look up see 
poly_coeffX.c.mako
poly_coeff_expr.py

Tests
=====
TODO: make a proper test suite.
For now the examples serves as tests together with
the tests in symodesys/tests (read MANIFEST.txt therein)


Performance tests
-----------------
See examples/perf.py, as of SciPy 0.11 you should expect about 3
orders of magnitude speed-up.


Dependencies
============
Python_
NumPy_
Mako_   (optional)
Cython_ 0.19 (optional)
Sympy_  (optional)

Bits and pieces with potential for usage outside cInterpol
==============================================================
newton_interval.c - Even though very simple it can be useful for quadratic
convergence lookup in ordered (strictly monotone) and well behaved arrays.

TODO
====
Add cubic splines
Add finite difference (Fornberg)
